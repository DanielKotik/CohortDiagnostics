<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A graph showing the incidence proportion over calender time, stratified by age (in 10-year bins) and gender.</p>

<p>The incidence proportion is computed as 1000 * the number of people <em>first</em> entering the cohort / the number of people eligible to enter the cohort for the first time. The eligble population is defined as those persons having at least one day of observation in the specified calendar year / age / gender stratum, who have not entered the cohort before, and have the required prior days of observation as specified in the cohort entry event criteria.</p>

<h3>Options</h3>
<p>You can select multiple databases in the side bar to see graphs from different databases in the same plot.</p>
<p>Select the cohort to explore in the side bar.</p>

<h3>What to look for</h3>
<ul>
<li>Are the observed incidence proportions in line with expectations? For example, if we have an estimate of the population incidence based on an external source, is the incidence proportion comparable to that estimate?</li>
<li>Are the age and gender distributions in line with expectations? For example, are contraceptives only prescribed in women?</li>
<li>Is the incidence proportion stable over time? If there are sudden peaks or drops, this may indicate coding issues.</li>
</ul>
