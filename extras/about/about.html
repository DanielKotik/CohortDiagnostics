      <p>OHDSI Phenotype Library is an open community resource maintained by the OHDSI community to support phenotype development, evaluation, sharing and re-use. The Phenotype Library is maintained by community librarians. They are volunteer collaborators who are curating the content contributed by the rest of the community to ensure it is appropriately organized and conforms to community library standards.</p>
      <p>The OHDSI Phenotype work group is responsible to facilitate the generation and maintenance of  the content in the library. To be included, every cohort definition is expected to belong to one Phenotype, and it should have at least one full result set from Cohort Diagnostics executed on  at least one data source. The output should have been contributed to the Phenotype library.</p>
      <p>All cohort definitions in the phenotype library are expressed in JSON and SQL (OHDSI SQL) instructions that are compatible with OHDSI analytic tools and OHDSI OMOP CDM v5.0+. Currently, cohort definitions in the Phenotype Library are implemented in OHDSI SQL compatible with OMOP CDM v5.0+, with JSON specifications compatible with the OHDSI ATLAS platform. Supporting content is organized in the respective folders: literature, notes and evaluation. Literature review is organized using a standardized template</p>
      <p><strong>How to download the library contents: </strong>To download the full set of phenotypes and cohort definitions please go to the <a href="https://github.com/ohdsi/phenotypeLibrary", target="_blank">OHDSI Phenotype Library GitHub repository</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>How to contribute a full set of phenotype library diagnostics across the full library:</strong> Please execute the <a href ="https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/phenotypeLibraryDiagnostics/", target="_blank">Phenotype Library Diagnostics</a> study package and submit the results to the coordinating site.</p>
      <p><strong>How to run diagnostics on your cohorts using Cohort Diagnostics:</strong> You can develop your own cohort using ATLAS and evaluate it using CohortDiagnostics, by following the instructions at <a href="https://github.com/ohdsi/cohortdiagnostics", target="_blank">OHDSI Cohort Diagnostics.</a>.</p>
